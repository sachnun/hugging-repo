# hugging-repo

GitHub action that'll push files of the current github code repository to the hugging face space code repository.

**ðŸš€ Pure Bash Implementation** - No Python dependencies required!

## Features

- âœ… Pure bash script implementation
- âœ… No Python/pip installation required
- âœ… Uses Hugging Face REST API directly
- âœ… Supports spaces, models, and datasets
- âœ… Automatic repository creation
- âœ… Private repository support

## Prerequisites

- `jq` - JSON processor (usually pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners)
- `curl` - HTTP client (usually pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners)
- `git` - Version control (usually pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners)

## Usage

The first step is to add a Hugging Face token with write access to your repo as a GitHub Secret. Below, which is called HF_TOKEN. Then, you can use this action in your repo as shown below.

```yaml
name: Deploy to huggingface

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: sachnun/hugging-repo@v1
        with:
          # The Hugging Face repo id you want to sync to.
          # A repo with this name will be created if it doesn't exist. Required.
          # The github username is not included. ex: not like this 'username/reponame', but like this: 'reponame'
          # the key of huggingface_repo can be omitted. If the key is commented out, it defaults to the same name as the Github repository.
          # huggingface_repo: 'ChatGPT'

          # Hugging Face token with write access. Required.
          # Here, we provide a token that we called `HF_TOKEN` when we added the secret to our GitHub repo.
          hf_token: ${{ secrets.HF_TOKEN }}

          # The type of repo you are syncing to: model, dataset, or space.
          # Defaults to space.
          repo_type: 'space'

          # If true and the Hugging Face repo doesn't already exist, it will be created
          # as a private repo.
          #
          # Note: this param has no effect if the repo already exists.
          private: false

          # If repo type is space, specify a space_sdk. One of: streamlit, gradio, or static
          #
          # This option is especially important if the repo has not been created yet.
          # It won't really be used if the repo already exists.
          space_sdk: 'gradio'
```

> `- uses: actions/checkout@v2` is not needed, because it's already included in this Action.

## Migration from Python Version

If you're upgrading from the Python-based version (v0.x), no changes are required to your workflow files. The bash implementation is a drop-in replacement with the same API.

## How It Works

1. The action checks out your repository
2. Retrieves your Hugging Face username using the API
3. Creates the repository if it doesn't exist
4. Initializes a git repository in your workspace
5. Pushes all files (except `.git` and `README.md`) to Hugging Face

## Local Testing

You can test the script locally:

```bash
bash push.sh \
  --huggingface_repo "your-repo-name" \
  --github_repo "username/repo-name" \
  --token "your-hf-token" \
  --repo_type "space" \
  --space_sdk "gradio" \
  --private "false"
```
